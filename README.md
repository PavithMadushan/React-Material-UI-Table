# React-Material-UI-Table

The minimum React version material-table supports is ^16.8.5 since material-table v1.36.1. This is due to utilising react-beautiful-dnd for drag & drop functionality which uses hooks.

If you use an older version of react we suggest to upgrade your dependencies or use material-table 1.36.0.
